    <title>Coding Basics: Count to 10 with a loop</title>

        // Count to 10 with a loop
        function count() {
            // A "for loop" will repeat code until the test statement is false.
            // There are three parts to a for loop:
            //   The first is the variable used to keep track of loop iterations.
            //     We will start the variable at 0.
            //   The second is the test condition for the loop. When this is false,
            //     the loop stops. In this case, the loop will run as long as the
            //     variable is smaller than 10.
            //   The third is how we modify the variable each iteration. In this
            //     case, we add 1 each time.

            //TODO: Make a "for loop" that will call incrementCounter() 10 times

            // Tell the counter to start counting
            runCounter();
